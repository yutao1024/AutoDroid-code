"Based on the previous UI actions and the current UI state, it seems that the user has already started the Gallery app. Therefore, the next action should be to sort the folders by name in descending order.\n\nTo do this, the user should interact with the following UI element:\n\n* id=2 - action=tap - input text=Show all folders content\n\nThis will display all the folders in the Gallery app, and the user can then sort them by name in descending order."
